    Chicken products contain cholesterol, carcinogens,
             and contaminants. Cholesterol, carcinogens, pathogens, 
             and even feces found in chicken products increase the risk of heart disease,
              breast and prostate cancers, urinary tract infections, and foodborne illness.

    While many people assume that sushi is also raw fish,
             it is actually vinegar rice that is mixed with a number of other ingredients, 
             which can include either cooked or raw fish. Wile raw fish may be a traditional staple in most types of sushi, 
            it is not a prerequisite for this dish.
